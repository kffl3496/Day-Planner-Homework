# Day-Planner-Homework

Created a day-planner that allows the user to edit time-blocks of their work day by-the-hour to remind them of certain events.  When the page is refreshed, it logs the descriptions for the time-block edited.  In addition, the time-block keeps logs the date of the user at the top and features color-dynamic css for the time-blocks that change according to the time of the day.
